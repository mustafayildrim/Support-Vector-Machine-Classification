# Support-Vector-Machine-Classification
This project implements binary classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to distinguish between two digits ('7' and '9') from a dataset. Both linear and nonlinear SVMs (using a Gaussian RBF kernel) are trained and evaluated, with hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.
